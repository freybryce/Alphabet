<!-- This template is for reddit results. We decided that since reddit is the front page of the internet that it would be the front page of our project (unless a different one is made default by user login). Things that should be included on this page (as far as we have discussed) include (from the top, down) a search bar that (for new searchs and to potentially show the current search), a set of tabs to switch between results pages, and search results. -->

<!-- New comments about the page as a whole, including questions, concerns, goals, etc. should be listed above this comment. -->
